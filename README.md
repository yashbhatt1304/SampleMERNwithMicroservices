# Sample MERN with Microservices



For `helloService`, create `.env` file with the content:
```bash
PORT=3001
```

For `profileService`, create `.env` file with the content:
```bash
PORT=3002
MONGO_URL="specifyYourMongoURLHereWithDatabaseNameInTheEnd"
```

Finally install packages in both the services by running the command `npm install`.

For frontend, you have to install and start the frontend server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Note: This will run the frontend in the development server. To run in production, build the application by running the command `npm run build`
